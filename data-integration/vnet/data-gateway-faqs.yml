  - name: Ignored
    questions:
      - question: |
          How can I secure connectivity from my network to Power BI?
        answer: |
          Use Private links to secure this connectivity. More information: [Power BI Private Links documentation](/power-bi/admin/service-security-private-links)  

      - question: |
          Where is my VNet data gateway?
        answer: |
          The VNet data gateway is physically in the same region as your Azure VNet. However, the metadata (name, details, data sources, encrypted credentials, and so on) for all your VNet data gateways are stored in your tenant’s default region. You can manage all VNet data gateways when you select your tenant’s home region in [Power platform admin center](manage-data-gateways.md).

      - question: |
          Does the VNet data gateway support conditional access policies?
        answer: |
          Yes. You can use a VNet data gateway and your conditional access policies will still apply.
          
      - question: |
          What data sources are supported on the VNet data gateway?
        answer: |
          A complete list of supported data services:

          * for Power BI is available in [Supported Azure data services](use-data-gateways-sources-power-bi.md#supported-azure-data-services)
          * for Power Platform dataflows is available in [Supported data sources](data-gateway-power-platform-dataflows.md#supported-data-sources)

      - question: |
          What are the licensing requirements in Power BI to use VNet data gateways?
        answer: |
          Virtual network data gateways are a premium-only feature, and is available only in Fabric and Power BI Premium capacities (currently only available for P and F SKUs, and not available for EM and A SKUs).

      - question: |
          Some of my data sources are connected to my VNet using service endpoint and some using private endpoint. Can I connect to all of them using VNet data gateways?
        answer: |
          Yes

      - question: |
          Why am I not able to create a service endpoint for my data source in my VNet?
        answer: |
          Review [Azure VNet documentation](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) for restrictions (for example, region related) on VNets, endpoints, and associated Azure resources.

      - question: |
          How do I create a private endpoint for my data sources and associate it to a VNet?
        answer: |
          Review the corresponding Azure data service product documentation to check if private endpoints are supported and on how to enable them.  

      - question: |
          Can I use this feature if my data source is in East US and my Power BI home region is in East US2?
        answer: |
          Yes, there's no dependency on the Power BI home region for this feature. If this feature is enabled in the region where the VNet exists, you'll be able to create a new VNet data gateway.

      - question: |
          Can I choose the region where VNet data gateways are created?
        answer: |
          No. The VNet data gateway is physically in the same region as your Azure VNet. Currently, you also can't choose where the metadata (name, details, data sources, encrypted credentials, and so on) for all your VNet data gateways are stored. It's stored in your tenant’s default region.

      - question: |
          Does VNet data gateway support cross-tenant scenarios?
        answer: |
          No. The VNet data gateway must be created in the same tenant as the Power BI tenant.

      - question: |
          Will I be able to use this feature if my tenant is in East US (United States) and Power platform environment is in Europe?
        answer: |
          No, VNet gateways are currently available only in your tenant’s home region.

      - question: |
          Why can’t I connect to the data source?
        answer: |
          Few areas to check:

          - Make sure your data source is up and running.
          - Make sure that the data source can be accessed from within the VNet&mdash;specifically from the subnet delegated while creating the VNet data gateway. For instance, you could deploy a VM in the subnet and check if you can connect to the data source.
          - The following Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) may be required depending on your scenario:
            - Allow outbound traffic to the Microsoft Entra ID endpoint while using OAuth authentication to connect to a data source.
            - Allow outbound traffic to CA (Certificate Authority) while using HTTPS to connect to a data source.

      - question: |
          How is the connectivity between the VNet service and your VNet secured?
        answer: |
          The connectivity between the new VNet service and your VNet is via HTTPS and TLS 1.2.

      - question: |
          Are there any known connectivity issues for SQL serverless with auto-pause?
        answer: |
          For SQL serverless with auto-pause, the first request might fail if SQL is in a paused state, but the next ones will succeed.

      - question: |
          Is there a delay when the VNet gateway is used for the first time or after a period of inactivity?
        answer: |
          When used for the first time, the VNet gateway takes about 2 minutes to get set up. Similarly, if the VNet data gateway isn't used for 30 minutes, you could experience a delay of about a minute the next time you use it.

      - question: |
          Is this feature supported in sovereign clouds?
        answer: |
          No, only commercial clouds will be supported for the public preview release.

      - question: |
          What is the hardware configuration for a VNet data gateway?
        answer: |
          Every VNet data gateway has a maximum capacity of:
          
          * 2 cores
          * 8 GB of RAM each
          
          At this time, this is the only available hardware configuration and it can't be scaled or changed.

      - question: |
          Can I create multiple VNet data gateways for the same Azure data service?  
        answer: |
          Yes

      - question: |
          Why can't I delete the subnet or the VNet that delegated to Power Platform?
        answer: |
          Check if there are other gateways using the same VNet and subnet. To be able to delete, it would take up to 48 to 72 hours after the last gateway using this VNet and subnet was removed.

      - question: |
          How large does the delegated subnet need to be?
        answer: |
          Beyond the five reserved IPs, our recommendation is to have approximately 5-7 more IPs so you can add more VNet gateways to the same VNet and Subnet.  

      - question: |
          I'm a subscription owner but I get an insufficient permissions error when I try to create a VNet data gateway
        answer: |
          Make sure you're explicitly in a role with the Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action permission on the VNet like the Azure Network Contributor role. This permission is required for creating a VNet data gateway.

      - question: |
          Does all of the data when using the VNet data gateway remain on Microsoft's backbone network when accessing Azure Data Sources?
        answer: |
          How does security compare to the on-premise data gateway?
          Yes, all the data going through a virtual network data gateway remains on the Azure backbone. We use an internal Microsoft tunnel that doesn't reach the public internet between the virtual network and Power BI service. On the other hand, the on-premise data gateway opens a connection to use Azure Relay to connect to the Power BI service.

      - question: |
          Which Azure components need to be in the same region?
        answer: | 
          Considering the various resources: subscription, Microsoft.PowerPlatform resource provider, virtual network, subnet, and Power BI Service's home tenant. 
          If you're using a service endpoint, the virtual network and subnet should be in the same region as the data to which you're connecting. If you're using a private endpoint, they can be in different regions. The data gateway configuration lives in the Power BI home tenant region. 

      - question: |
          Is there any way to connect from the subnet of one VNet to the data source of another VNet?
        answer: |
          A VNet gateway can generally reach sources that are reachable within that same VNet. If there's another VNet that's completely isolated from the first, then another VNet gateway is necessary.
           
      - question: |
          Any other known issues?
        answer: |
          * The VNet's subnet's IP range can't overlap with 10.0.1.x.
          * You can't delegate a subnet called `gatewaysubnet` to the Power Platform admin center. This restriction is because it's a reserved word for the Azure Gateway Subnet feature.
          * You can't change the region, subscription, or resource group for the VNet on which the VNet data gateway was created. This scenario isn't currently supported.
          * If an OAuth refresh that takes longer that one hour is canceled with the error "Invalid Connection Credentials" or timeout, the issue is likely that the credential expired.
