# Create virtual network data gateways

> [!NOTE]
>The metadata (name, details, data sources, encrypted credentials, and so on) for all your VNet data gateways are stored in your tenant’s default region. However, the VNet data gateway runs in the same region as your Azure VNet.

Creating a virtual network (VNet) data gateway is a 3-step process:

> [Step 1: Register Microsoft.PowerPlatform as a resource Provider](#step-1-register-microsoftpowerplatform-as-a-resource-provider)

> [Step 2: Associate the subnet to Microsoft Power Platform](#step-2-associate-the-subnet-to-microsoft-power-platform)

> [Step 3: Create a VNet data gateway](#step-3-create-a-vnet-data-gateway)

> [!NOTE]
> Before creating a VNet data gateway, check that the feature is [supported in your region](#regions-supported-for-vnet-data-gateways).

## Step 1: Register Microsoft.PowerPlatform as a resource Provider

On the Azure portal, sign in as a subscription owner and register `Microsoft.PowerPlatform` as a resource provider for the subscription that contains the VNet. This enables your subscription to work with this resource provider.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to the specific subscription.

1. Select **Resource Providers**.

1. Search for **Microsoft.PowerPlatform**, and select **Register**.

## Step 2: Associate the subnet to Microsoft Power Platform

A user in a role with the Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action permission on the VNet like the Azure [Network Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor) role can delegate the subnet within the same VNet to Microsoft Power Platform. Subnet delegation enables you to designate a specific subnet for an Azure PaaS service of your choice that needs to be injected into your virtual network.

This subnet should have connectivity to the data service.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. [Add a new subnet](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet#add-a-subnet) in the VNet. This new subnet cannot be shared with other services but will be used entirely by the Power Platform VNet service. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > * Don’t use the subnet name, “gatewaysubnet”, as this is a reserved word for the Azure Gateway Subnet feature. You won't be able to use it to create a VNet data gateway in Step 3.
    > * Make sure this subnet doesn't have an IPV6 address space added.

1. Select **Resource Providers**.

1. Select **Microsoft.PowerPlatform/vnetaccesslinks** from the subnet delegation drop-down list.

1. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Create a VNet data gateway

A Microsoft Power Platform user enables the subnet for use in Microsoft Power Platform and creates a VNet data gateway. By doing this, the user authorizes the Microsoft Power Platform VNet service to inject containers into the subnet. The user also needs to have the Azure [Network Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor) role in the subscription to be able to perform this action.

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Data (preview)**.

1. Select **Virtual network (VNet) data gateway** > **New**. 

1. Select the subscription, resource group, VNet and the Subnet. You will only see subnets that are delegated to Microsoft Power Platform in the drop-down list. The dropdown for which the gateway is to be created is limited to 50. For this reason ( and if you have more than 50 subscriptions in Azure portal), some of those subscriptions won’t be listed.

1. By default, we provide a unique name for this data gateway, but you could optionally update it.

1. Select **Save**. You will now see this VNet data gateway in your **Virtual network data gateways** tab.Note that a VNet data gateway is a managed gateway which could be used for controlling access to this resource for Power platform users.
