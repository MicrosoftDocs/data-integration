# Set the datacenter region for the on-premises data gateway

During installation of the on-premises data gateway, you can set the datacenter region used by the gateway.

If you're registered for either Power BI or Office 365, the datacenter region by default is the region of the registered service's tenant. Otherwise, the datacenter region might be the Azure region closest to you.

> [!NOTE]
> For sovereign clouds and in Power BI's default region, we currently only support installing gateways in the default Power BI region of your tenant. The region picker on the installer is only supported for Public cloud.

## Restore, migrate, or take over a gateway in a nondefault region

During installation, after you sign in, you can choose **Migrate, restore, or takeover an existing gateway.** If you want to migrate, restore, or take over a gateway in a nondefault Power BI region, select **Change Region**, and then select the region you want to use.

## Current datacenter region

To find the current datacenter region after you install the gateway:

1. Open the [on-premises data gateway app](service-gateway-app.md) and sign in to your account.
1. In the **Status** tab, your datacenter region appears under **Logic Apps, Azure Analysis Services**.
