title: On-premises and virtual network (VNet) data gateways documentation
summary: The on-premises data gateway provides quick and secure data transfer between on-premises data and several Microsoft cloud services, such as Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate, Azure Analysis Services, and Azure Logic Apps. A virtual network (VNet) data gateway helps you to connect from Microsoft Cloud services to your Azure data services within a virtual network without the need of an on-premises data gateway.
