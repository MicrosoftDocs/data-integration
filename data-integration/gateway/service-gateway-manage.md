# Manage an on-premises data gateway

After you install an on-premises data gateway, you manage it based on your requirements. Because each service might integrate gateways differently, the management options differ depending on the service.

> [!NOTE]
> **Manage gateways** doesn't show up until you're the admin of at least one gateway. You become an admin either by being added as an admin or because you installed and configured a gateway.

## Manage a gateway in the Power BI service

For information on how to manage an on-premises data gateway data source in the Power BI service, go to [Add or remove a gateway data source](/power-bi/connect-data/service-gateway-data-sources).

## Manage a gateway in the Power Platform admin center

For information on how to manage an on-premises data gateway data source in the Power Platform admin center, go to [On-premises data gateway management](/power-platform/admin/onpremises-data-gateway-management).
